# Post Place

Post Place is a social media application where users can make posts and interact with posts by liking and commenting on them.

## How to run the app
(Meant to be used with PostPlace-API)

1. Fork or clone the github repo and open up the folder in the CLI
2. Install all dependencies (Bring up 2 terminals, cd into client on one and server on the other, run 'npm i' in both.)
3. Hook up an empty MongoDB collection to the server and set a JWT secret, setting them to CONNECTION_URL and JWT_SECRET in an .env file in the server folder.
- If you'd like to seed the database, run 'node dataSeeding' in the server directory.
4. Connect your server to the clientside via .env files in client / server folders.
- Optionally connect a google OAuth clientID to the front end if it isn't too much trouble and/or you want the google login to work.
5. Run the client and server locally via the npm start command.
6. Navigate to the URL you chose for the clientside and the app should be running.

## Features

1. A user can sign up for an account, sign in, sign in via google, or use a guest account.

5. A signed-in user can make, delete or like comments tied to a specific post by visiting its page.
6. All actions where applicable will be displayed in real time to all users.
